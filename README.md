## Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get the project up and running quickly.

### Installation

Install all dependencies for both frontend and backend:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Project

Start both the frontend and backend servers:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will:
- Kill any process running on port 8000
- Start the frontend development server (Vite) on `http://localhost:8080`
- Start the backend server on `http://localhost:8000`

Both servers will run concurrently, and you'll see colored output for each:
- **FRONTEND** (blue) - React frontend
- **backend** (green) - Backend API server

**Note:** Make sure you have Node.js installed before running these commands.
